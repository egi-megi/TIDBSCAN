"Those changes meant that although four senior judges considered that Khan was dangerous, he was to be automatically released half-way through because of Labour‚Äôs 2008 law.

A number of people have pointed out that the judgment of the Court of Appeal makes a reference to the Parole Board.

"Unfortunately, Khan could not be sentenced under the EDS scheme because it was not yet in force in December 2010 when he committed the offence.

"If Khan had been sentenced under the new EDS scheme there would have been no automatic early release and he would only have been able to ask for Parole Board consideration at 2/3rds of his sentence.

"Had the 2008 changes to the law not been made he would not have been eligible for automatic early release, instead the Parole Board would have had to decide whether he was safe to be released (11/16)",,,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074246417563648,"Dec 01, 2019"
"Khan was sentenced under Labour‚Äôs old regime. Therefore, he was to be automatically released after serving only half of his sentence (i.e. 8 years). Given time on remand, this meant he was released in December 2018 (10/16)",,,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074245364785152,"Dec 01, 2019"
"However, since the judges still considered him to be dangerous he got an EPP. The Court of Appeal could not have given him an EDS because these were not in force when he committed the offence in December 2010 (9/16).",,,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074244219740160,"Dec 01, 2019"
This means Khan would be detained indefinitely after he has served the minimum term unless the Parole Board considered him safe. Khan appealed. The Court of Appeal agreed that he was dangerous but felt that his crime was not serious enough to warrant an IPP (8/16),,,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074243011780608,"Dec 01, 2019"
Khan was sentenced by the Crown Court on 9th February 2012. He was considered dangerous by the Judge and so the two possible options available at the time were IPP or Post 2008 EPP. The judge opted for IPP with a minimum term of 8 years (7/16),,,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074241875140608,"Dec 01, 2019"

"In 2008 Labour introduced the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. This removed the requirement of Parole Board approval. This meant that, for EPPs after 2008, release would be automatic at the halfway point - no matter how dangerous the criminal (5/16)",https://t.co/mHrMVrrXMZ,http://t.co/mHrMVrrXMZ,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074232953856000,"Dec 01, 2019"
"An EPP has two elements: a custodial part and an extended licence period. When EPPs were brought in by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, there was no automatic early release during the custodial part - see s. 247(2)(b) of the original act (4/16)",https://t.co/ZEFCr9c6nl,http://t.co/ZEFCr9c6nl,https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1201074226381434880,"Dec 01, 2019"
