Someone who would doubtless scream bigotry if they saw Isis used to justify attacks on Muslims immediately harangues her about Netanyahu‚Äôs government without a shred of self-awareness.,https://t.co/g5gfeEKRE8,http://t.co/g5gfeEKRE8,https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1056487141713297409,"Oct 28, 2018"
